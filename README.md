# Sleep Deprivation Simulator - Chrome Extension

## Inspiration
The inspiration behind this Chrome extension stemmed from observing how sleep deprivation often leads students to perceive blurry texts and images. I aimed to replicate this phenomenon through a Chrome extension that visually simulates this experience by blurring the active browser tab.

## What it does
The **Sleep Deprivation Simulator** Chrome extension provides two main functionalities through its interface:
- **Start Simulator**: Initiates the blurring effect on the current browser tab. After about a minute, the text and images on the page begin to blur gradually.
- **Stop Simulator**: Halts the blurring effect, returning the page to its original clarity.

## How we built it
The Chrome extension was developed using a combination of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. These technologies enabled us to design the user interface and implement the logic for dynamically applying the blurring effect.

## Challenges we ran into
- Initially, it was challenging to configure the extension to appear correctly in the browser.
- The blurring effect required troubleshooting JavaScript logic errors, which occasionally prevented the effect from being applied consistently across tabs.

## Achievements that we're proud of
- Successfully created a functional Chrome extension within a limited timeframe during a hackathon (approximately 4 hours remaining).
- Implemented the blurring effect, which was the core feature of the Chrome extension.

## What we learned
- **Technical Skills**: Gained a deeper understanding of how to set up and develop Chrome extensions.
- **Time Management**: Learned how to prioritize tasks effectively and work efficiently under time constraints.

## What's next for Sleep Deprivation Simulator
- **Interactive Features**: Introducing mini-games within the extension, allowing users to "win back" the clarity of their page by completing specific tasks.
- **Technological Enhancement**: Transitioning the project to **ReactJS** to improve the user interface and add more sophisticated functionality.
- **Customization**: Adding user settings to control the intensity and duration of the blurring effect for a more personalized experience.

## Built With
- **CSS**
- **HTML**
- **JavaScript**
